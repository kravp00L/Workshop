-- 
Attention: Camila A. Jaramillo Abarca

I got your contact in the course of my inquiry to locate relations of my deceased client who 
died with his family in a car crash on 5th August 2024. Please I need your assistance to 
repatriate the unclaimed deposit which my Deceased Client left behind in a Finance 
Company. The finance company in possession of the deposit that contains this fund has 
been asking me to provide the next of kin.

Since his demise they are threatening to confiscate the deposit as "Unclaimed Deposit". 
Rather than leaving the fund confiscated, I decided to trace his last name over the Internet, 
to locate any member of his family hence I contacted you. Based on the fact that you share 
the same last name with my deceased client I seek your consent and assistance to 
nominate you as my deceased client's relation under legal process and risk free to 
repatriate the fund as I have the jurisdiction as the deceased personal attorney to testify 
the deceased relationship with you.

Also I have the documents to complete the legal procedures. What I require is your 
willingness to assist me and to treat the transaction as a personal confidential matter until 
the conclusion that I will be entitled to 3% commission as gratification to my services to 
you. Kindly reply to me for further information and commencement of the transaction.

Sincerely,
